# My Game Development Journey with Pygame
My journey into game development with Pygame began with the folder PygameProgramPractices. Here, I combined my existing programming skills with new ones to create a variety of games. Some of the games I created include 2-player airplane battle, Balloon Bucket, Plane Defender, Clicking Simulator, Dealership, Ping Pong, and Tic Tac Toe.

Using the skills I learned, I continued to build bigger games like Connect4, Wood_Tycoon, and The Tale of the Serpent. However, during this process, I realized that my code was getting quite messy and inefficient.

I've acquired several useful skills from these projects, including importing images and buffering, gaining a better understanding of how to use functions effectively, working with arrays, storing data, game loop, and buttons.

I noticed that my codes were getting bigger and lacked classes, which was hindering the efficiency of the games. After this realization, I decided to focus on code efficiency and implementing classes better. Even though I was working on game development, I learned a lot about the importance of functions and how to use them effectively.

My journey with Pygame taught me valuable lessons about game development and programming in general. I'm proud of the progress I made during this time, and I'm excited to continue honing my skills in the future.

Game Descriptions:

2-Player Airplane Battle:
This game had a simple concept: two players each controlled a plane on opposite sides of a border and tried to eliminate the other's plane. The characters were moved via keyboard controls.

Balloon Bucket:
Similar to 2-Player Airplane Battle, this game was easy to understand. Players moved a bucket to catch as many balloons as possible, with a scoring system keeping track of progress.

Plane Defender:
In this game, the player controlled a plane that could move left and right and shoot bullets. The objective was to stop enemies from reaching the plane by shooting them down as they zigzagged downwards. After each enemy was defeated, another would spawn and the game would continue until the player lost.

Clicking Simulator:
In this game, players earned money by tapping a center image. They could then spend their earnings on two different options: hiring a worker who earned money at a constant rate, or doubling the value of their taps to earn more money per tap.

Dealership:
This game simulated an economy where players could purchase one of three houses. Prices for each house changed over time, and the objective was to buy low and sell high. Each house had a different price range and buying them carried varying risks and rewards. Players started with $100.

Ping Pong, Tic Tac Toe and Connect 4:
I created the classic game ping Pong and Tic Tac Toe.

Wood Tycoon:
This was one of my larger scalled games where I created a Starting Menu a Game interface and a store menu. The game worked where you had the player who has a avator chopping wood every click which you could sell for money. using hte money you could buy better axes to get more wood per chop and cutomizabe trees with high price value when sold. The goal of the game was to get the best customize tree and best axe. 

The Tail of the Serpent:
Was a game I made in tring to make a game simular to snake like I made in java. Though instead I had a level system where the goal of the game was to arrange its body in a way to hover above the required shapes on the map. The game gave a snake with a Custom body each level. 

Note: I did come to a stop mid development of this game so I could start learning how to use classes more effectively.
